Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to uncover hidden trends and factors that contribute to the success or failure of campaigns. Using Excel, we've organized the data, applied conditional formatting, created calculated columns for additional insights, and visualized the data through various charts and pivot tables.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following fields:

ID: Unique identifier for each campaign
Name: Name of the campaign
Category & Sub-Category: Classification of the campaign
Goal: Funding goal
Pledged: Amount pledged by backers
Outcome: Status of the campaign (e.g., "successful", "failed")
Backers Count: Number of backers
Country: Origin country of the campaign
Currency: Currency in which the campaign is denominated
Launched_at: Start date of the campaign (in Unix timestamp)
Deadline: End date of the campaign (in Unix timestamp)
Additional Calculated Fields: "Percent Funded", "Average Donation", etc.
Features
Conditional Formatting: Visual identification of campaign outcomes.
Calculated Columns: Percentage of funding achieved and average donation per backer.
Date Conversion: Transformation of Unix timestamps to a human-readable date format.
Pivot Tables: Aggregation of data for analysis.
Pivot Charts: Visual representations of trends over time and by categories.
Filters and Slicers: Interactive elements for dynamic data exploration.
Installation
No installation is necessary for this project beyond Microsoft Excel. Ensure you have a recent version of Excel installed to utilize all functionalities used in the project.

Usage
Open the Excel workbook (CrowdfundingBook.xlsx) to interact with the dataset:

Use the tabs at the bottom to navigate through sheets containing raw data, pivot tables, and charts.
Filters can be applied in pivot tables to view specific subsets of data.
Charts provide a graphical representation of the data that can be filtered by category, date, and other fields.
